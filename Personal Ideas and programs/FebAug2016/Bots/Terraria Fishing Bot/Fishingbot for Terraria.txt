DESCRIPTION - I was playing one of my games by my self and I was fishing. And inevitably
I got bored after the first 30 minutes because its just clicking the left mouse button and the right times. So I decided
I would make a bot to do it for me, I created a program what would look at the pixels on the screen and determine when
a fish was hooked onto the line. Then it would simply simulate a mouse and left click on the screen bringing the fish in.
Afterwards it would repeat the process.

FILES - They are in visual studio on my personal computer
