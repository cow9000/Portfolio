							<p>The Maker Collective is a student-run, Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) focus group that aims to instill in students the desire to create new technologies by opening their eyes to the technology that surrounds them. Class members learn about technology, and explore technology in a hands-on environment that leverages the latest STEM-related projects that the "maker movement" has to offer.</p>
							<p>Here are a few topics that we will learn about.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>We will learn how to fly <b>Drones</b> which are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot. The aircraft may be remotely controlled or can fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems working in conjunction with GPS.</li>
								<li>We will be working with <b>Arduinos</b> which are digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world. We will learn how to program them and create software to control these Arduinos.</li>
								<li>We will learn how to create a <b>computer</b> and how to purchase parts that are compatible with each other.</li>
								<li>And many more.</li>
							</ul>
