								<div id="F1">
									<p class="question">How does the Special Agent Mission Program help motivate my child?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Kids love games! What better way to help kids learn about the world 
									they live in than to help them learn through games and circumstances they run into every day.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F2">
									<p class="question">What is the recommended age to start using these games?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer"> Involve your child as soon as you can.
									 They may not get the full concept though they are becoming familiar with the structure. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F3">
									<p class="question">Rewards aren’t they bribes?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer"> There is a fine line between rewards and bribes.
									The Special Agent Program has taken precautions to set a goal that focuses on earnings, establishing an idea of work.
									A helpful article regarding this topic is found on the website - </p><a class="answer" href="http://www.empoweringparents.com/Bribing-Kids-Vs-Rewarding-Kids-Whats-The-Difference.php#ixzz2e3K6bWhg">Empowering Parents</a>. 
								</div>					
								<div id="F4">
									<p class="question">Will my children take me seriously?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Children love fun ways of learning new ideas or working on things that are a harder for them to understand.
									 If anything, they will think it is neat and creative.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F5">
									<p class="question">Isn’t this a lot of work?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Getting the materials together is a lot of work, but once it is together, it is consistency that is the hardest thing. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F6">
									<p class="question">Will these things really work?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">I have seen this program work first hand.  With my children, even though there are hard days, they have a structure and a fun “thing” to fall back on.  It has lessened the fighting and encouraged the getting along.  It has helped set a focus in their lives and in mine too.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F7">
									<p class="question">I feel like I have so little time with my kids, I work all day, I come home, I am tired, what do I do?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">I understand that in many families both parents work, leaving little time to be with children. It is amazing how a small amount of time can benefit and make a difference. Use the games at your convenience. The calendar, posters, special agent suitcase all help to keep the structure at the front of the mind.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F8">
									<p class="question">Should I use this program for all children in my home?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Yes, we suggest using it with all children in your home.  Each child has something that can be improved or worked towards.  Additionally, it is a program that is made for the enjoyment and learning of children!</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F9">
									<p class="question">One of my children could really use some extra motivation, though my other is pretty self- motivated, I don’t want to take away anything that she/he already accomplishes as a natural instinct, what should I do? </p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Yes, all children are different.  There are a variety of games for kids to participate in. We are sure they will find them fun and enjoyable and they won’t even feel like they are being motivated. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F10">
									<p class="question"> How do I start using what I already give my children as rewards?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">This can be tricky. Though, it can be done! You can let your children know that you are going to start playing a game and they will now have the opportunity to start earning rewards.  An example from <a class="answer" href="http://www.empoweringparents.com/Bribing-Kids-Vs-Rewarding-Kids-Whats-The-Difference.php#ixzz2e3K6bWhg">this article</a> is to explain the new Build ME Blocks program in relation to work. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F11">
									<p class="question">My kids are misbehaving how do I remind them of their special agent mission contract without it seeming like a bribe? </p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Remind them they agreed to their special agent mission contract and some of those things include the ideas listed on the Special Agent Mission poster.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F12">
									<p class="question">Does the Special Agent Mission Program have consequences for the negative behavior?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Each parent has their way and view of consequences for negative behavior. Negative behavior always needs to be addressed.</p>
									<h2>Special Agent Mission is a program that focuses on actions and behaviors. In this program the suggested consequence is the use of Special Agent Obstacle Busters.  Games are played, tokens are won.  A child’s goal is to earn all the tokens involved in the game.  When they come upon a negative behavior, they can either choose a Special Agent Obstacle buster to keep the full value of their rewards or face the consequence of losing a token.</h2>
