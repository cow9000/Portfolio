							<p class='large_text p1' style='float:right; display:inline;'><img src='../images/Image2.jpg' style='margin:15px; border:3px solid black; float: left;'/> Hi Parents!<br><br>  We’re Max and Elena.  We are the Special Agent Mission leaders, for the Special Agent program that help give you and your kids ideas for games around the house and tools for when sticky problems happen—at home, school, with friends, etc.<br><br> It’s time to get creative! We give you the tools, and an organized program so you and your kids can create together. <br><br>We love to communicate with your kids, so have them send us a message.  We love to hear how they are doing with the games, how they like them, what they would like to see different and how they are doing with their missions. With your permission, we will randomly select messages to post on our blog.  On our blog we write about our travels, places we’ve been, things we learn.  We hope you and your children will visit us often.<br><br> We look forward to having fun with you and your kids!<br><br> Happy Missions! <br>Max & Elena</p>
