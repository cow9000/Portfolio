								<div id="F1">
									<p class="question">How does the Special Agent Mission Program help motivate my child?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Kids love games! What better way to help kids learn about the world 
									they live in than to help them learn through games and circumstances they run into every day.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F2">
									<p class="question">What is the recommended age to start using these games?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer"> Involve your child as soon as you can.
									 They may not get the full concept though they are becoming familiar with the structure. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F3">
									<p class="question">Rewards aren’t they bribes?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer"> There is a fine line between rewards and bribes.
									The Special Agent Program has taken precautions to set a goal that focuses on earnings, establishing an idea of work.
									A helpful article regarding this topic is found on the website - </p><a class="answer" href="http://www.empoweringparents.com/Bribing-Kids-Vs-Rewarding-Kids-Whats-The-Difference.php#ixzz2e3K6bWhg">Empowering Parents</a>. 
								</div>					
								<div id="F4">
									<p class="question">Will my children take me seriously?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Children love fun ways of learning new ideas or working on things that are a harder for them to understand.
									 If anything, they will think it is neat and creative.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F5">
									<p class="question">Isn’t this a lot of work?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Getting the materials together is a lot of work, but once it is together, it is consistency that is the hardest thing. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F6">
									<p class="question">Will these things really work?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">I have seen this program work first hand.  With my children, even though there are hard days, they have a structure and a fun “thing” to fall back on.  It has lessened the fighting and encouraged the getting along.  It has helped set a focus in their lives and in mine too.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F7">
									<p class="question">I feel like I have so little time with my kids, I work all day, I come home, I am tired, what do I do?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">I understand that in many families both parents work, leaving little time to be with children. It is amazing how a small amount of time can benefit and make a difference. Use the games at your convenience. The calendar, posters, special agent suitcase all help to keep the structure at the front of the mind.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F8">
									<p class="question">Should I use this program for all children in my home?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Yes, we suggest using it with all children in your home.  Each child has something that can be improved or worked towards.  Additionally, it is a program that is made for the enjoyment and learning of children!</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F9">
									<p class="question">One of my children could really use some extra motivation, though my other is pretty self- motivated, I don’t want to take away anything that she/he already accomplishes as a natural instinct, what should I do? </p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Yes, all children are different.  There are a variety of games for kids to participate in. We are sure they will find them fun and enjoyable and they won’t even feel like they are being motivated. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F10">
									<p class="question"> How do I start using what I already give my children as rewards?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">This can be tricky. Though, it can be done! You can let your children know that you are going to start playing a game and they will now have the opportunity to start earning rewards.  An example from <a class="answer" href="http://www.empoweringparents.com/Bribing-Kids-Vs-Rewarding-Kids-Whats-The-Difference.php#ixzz2e3K6bWhg">this article</a> is to explain the new Build ME Blocks program in relation to work. </p>
								</div>
								<div id="F11">
									<p class="question">My kids are misbehaving how do I remind them of their special agent mission contract without it seeming like a bribe? </p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Remind them they agreed to their special agent mission contract and some of those things include the ideas listed on the Special Agent Mission poster.</p>
								</div>
								<div id="F12">
									<p class="question">Does the Special Agent Mission Program have consequences for negative behavior?</p>
									<br>
									<p class="answer">Special Agent Mission is a program that focuses on actions and behaviors.  While specific consequences aren’t given (each parent has their way and view of consequences), the game that is suggested for consequences is Obstacle Busters.  With Obstacles Busters the game emphasizes positive behaviors and eliminating negative behaviors.</p>
