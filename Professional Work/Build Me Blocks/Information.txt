DESCRIPTION - 

I created a website with a Content Management System so that the client could edit the website without knowing how to code
I also created a system that hooked into paypal and read the IPN. This system allowed the user to purchase online files,
and then a request would be sent to paypal and then that request back to the website. The website would then read 
who purchased the files, and then would give the user access to the files.

The design was made from a template purchased online but I had to do major work to make the template work for the client.
