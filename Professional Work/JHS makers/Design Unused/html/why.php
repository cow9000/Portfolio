							<p>Providing students with the

opportunity to tinker and proactively 

explore the technological world around 

them will help in the following ways:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Enhanced intellectual curiosity</b>. Students will feel more comfortable asking questions, not only about technology and how computers and robots work, but also across all subject matters.</li>
								<li><b>Expanded understanding of technology</b>. Projects establish a firm foundation of basic skills and quickly ramp to university-level complexity. Though some projects will be complex, the complexity will present itself as an exciting challenge (e.g., how do we get this robot to do X?) vs. as an insurmountable obstacle.</li>
								<li><b>Strengthened communication, group decision making and teamwork skills.</b> Students flex these skills as they work their way through complex projects - often encountering issues or "bugs" that must be understood and solved as a team.</li>
								<li><b>Increased leadership skills</b>. Students lead the project and are responsible for project management and problem solving. Students grow as leaders as they do STEM outreach events at middle schools and in the community.</li>
								<li><b>Cutting edge technology and teaching methods</b>. Projects mirror learning activities found at Duke University's Talent Identification Program (BOE-Bot construction & coding) and England's University of Lincoln (InMoov full-sized android). Teaching methods also align with those used at MIT's Media Lab - where students learn in a very hands-on environment.</li>
